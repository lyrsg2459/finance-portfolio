## 1. Revenue & Income Statement

| Assumption | Value(s) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue growth | FY27: 18% → FY31: 9% (declining) | Company guidance — Q1 FY27 revenue growth of 18% to ~$90B; blended rate assumed to normalize as Azure capacity constraints ease |
| Cost of Revenue (% of Revenue) | 32.5% → 33.6% (rising) | Microsoft Cloud gross margin decline, FY26 Q3 earnings; attributed to AI infrastructure investment |
| R&D (% of Revenue) | 10.3% → 9.4% (declining, floored ~9.0–9.5%) | Revenue outgrowing R&D dollar growth; continued Azure-related R&D investment |
| S&M (dollar growth %) | 4.1% → 2.82% (declining) | Not modeled as proportional to revenue; grown at inflation (IMF CPI 3.2% FY27–28, PCE 2.22% FY29–31) plus a wage/product-push premium |
| G&A (dollar growth %) | 3.2% → 2.22% (declining) | FY23–26 growth attributed to one-off items (FY23 severance, FY24–25 Activision Blizzard integration costs, FY26 legal fees/divestiture gains); forecast reset to inflation-linked baseline (same CPI/PCE split as S&M) |

## 2. Free Cash Flow Build

| Assumption | Value(s) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Effective tax rate | 19.6% → 20.2% (rising toward 21%) | FY26 10-K: rate reversal (17.6% → 19.4%) driven by U.S. income mix rising from 56.0% to 62.4% of total; projected to continue toward the U.S. federal statutory rate |
| D&A / PP&E useful life | 5.98 years | Back-solved: FY26 opening PP&E ($204,966M) ÷ FY26 pure depreciation expense per Note 6 ($34,300M); falls within the 10-K's disclosed 2–6 year range for servers/network equipment |
| CapEx (% of Revenue) | 44.7% (FY27) → 37.8% (FY31), declining but floored above 34.9% | FY27 figure taken directly from company guidance ($175B); subsequent years assumed to normalize as Azure/cloud capacity constraints ease |
| NWC (% of Revenue) | -14.16% (3-year average, held flat FY27–31) | FY24–26 10-K balance sheets; FY26 adjusted to exclude a one-off $19.6B increase in supplier prepayments for server components (disclosed in the contract balances/other receivables note) |

## 3. WACC

| Assumption | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Shares outstanding | 7,427M | FY26 10-K balance sheet |
| Share price | $373.02 | Yahoo Finance, close as at June 30, 2026 (matched to valuation date) |
| Risk-free rate | 4.718% | Current 10-year US Treasury yield |
| Beta | 1.13 | Yahoo Finance, 5-year monthly beta |
| Equity risk premium | 4.42% | Aswath Damodaran (NYU), July 2026 equity risk premium list |
| Cost of long-term debt (blended, pre-tax) | 3.85% | Note 10 (Debt), FY26 10-K — effective interest rate per issuance, weighted by face value; midpoints used where a range was disclosed |
| Cost of finance leases (pre-tax) | 4.50% | Note 13 (Leases), FY26 10-K — disclosed directly as the weighted average discount rate |
| Tax rate (for debt/lease tax shield) | 21.00% | U.S. federal statutory rate — chosen over the model's own blended effective rate, since interest deductibility applies at the marginal rate |
| MV of long-term debt | $36,500M | FY26 10-K, disclosed fair value (not book/carrying value of $40,294M) |
| MV of finance leases | $66,594M | Note 13, FY26 10-K |
| Net debt (EV-to-equity bridge) | -$82,159M | MV of debt + MV of finance leases (both from WACC's own capital structure) − cash & cash equivalents ($20,935M, FY26 10-K balance sheet) |
| **WACC (output)** | **9.485%** | Calculated: (We × Re) + (Wd × After-Tax Rd), blended across equity, long-term debt, and finance leases |
